<b>Old Message Receiving Mode</b>
✅ Chats that you have not personally read remain unread (lit orange).

❌ <i>FPC</i> cannot determine exactly who wrote: you or the person you are chatting with. If the chat is not read, then the message is from the interlocutor, otherwise it is from you. However, if you are viewing the chat when you receive messages, this logic can sometimes fail. Also, <i>FPC</i> will not be able to determine if a 3rd party (arbitrator) wrote into the chat.

❗ If you click the <code>More</code> button in a new message notification, <i>FPC</i> will "read" the chat and show the last 15 messages, including images. <i>FPC</i> will also be able to determine who the author of the messages is."""
